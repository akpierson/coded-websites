			<h1 id="navWhat" class="announcer">What We Do</h1>
			<div class="breaker"></div>
			<p class="info">Thank you for visiting Strategic Business Consulting, Inc. Most business owners either start their own business or purchase an existing business to create a better life for themselves and their families. Many want to make more money and have more free time including personal freedom to do what they want and when they want. Does that sound familiar? Often the reality of owning a business is less than what you probably expected. Many business owners are finding that their business dreams are taking longer to come about, they are working harder than anticipated, and… the business that they put so much into is actually costing them money! You might be asking yourself “What happened to my dream?”<br><br>

			In many cases, the owner of the business starts out as a “technician,” being highly skilled in a certain field, product, or service. As the business grows, the owner needs other business skills he or she may not have. Over time the business moves from being a profitable small operation to a larger one that either loses money, or only pays basic wages to the owner with no additional profits or dividends. In many cases, the owner often has to dip into home equity lines of credit or borrow on credit cards hoping that tomorrow will be better. Without a clear understanding of all the principles that make a business successful, the financial situation often doesn’t change and the business just drifts from year to year. Doctors have for decades told us that stress is a killer, and yet we may have created a business that has more than its fair share of anxiety. Very likely you may feel quite alone and isolated. What’s more, you may not really have anyone to turn to for help.

			<p class="info">Strategic Business Consulting is more than just a consulting firm. It might be better to call us your business success partner. We take a different approach to many business consultants that make what we do unique and highly effective for business owners.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="heading-bold">First Step: We need to schedule three meetings with you.</p>
			<br>
			<b>Meeting 1:</b>
			<p class="info">The first meeting will help us build a business profile. About 1 Hour Long.</p>
			<br>
			<b>Meeting 2:</b>
			<p class="info">During this meeting we will run a business diagnostic on 11 key areas of your business. This diagnostic meeting will help us to determine the "Profit Leakage or an Income Gap” your business is currently facing. We will also classify your business: Rescue, Improve or Grow. This meeting has been referred by some as “the most important meeting they ever had about their business.” You will clearly see in what areas your business is doing well and what areas it may need help with.</p>
			<br>
			<b>Meeting 3:</b>
			<p class="info">Our third meeting will be a proposal meeting on what Strategic Business Consulting can do to help solve your business challenges and ultimately improve the PROFIT, GROWTH and the VALUE of your business.</p>
			<div class="breaker"></div>
			<br>
			<p class="info">At that point we will determine one of three categories your business is currently in: Rescue, Improve or Grow. We will then create a business success program specific to your company. The plan will provide a structured framework to deliver the income you want from your business.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="heading-bold">What can you expect from this plan?</p>

			<div class="breaker"></div>
			<p>Below are some fictitious scenarios to highlight how certain business challenges could be met with a Strategic Business Consultant.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="heading-bold">Scenario #1</p>
			<br>
			<p>Bob's Bakery</p>
			<br>
			<b>THE PROBLEM</b>
			<br>
			<p class="info">Bob was an apprentice baker in a regional town and had just become a tradesman; he longed for his own business. He was married with two children and had a nice house in a nice part of town. Bob decided to go into business and found an old gas station on the main road that was up for lease. He took the lease and borrowed money from the bank against his house to get started. The money was used to buy the bakery equipment and outfit the shop. 

			Bob's Bakery was an overnight success and he became a local celebrity (local lad does good etc). Bob bought two new cars and paid for them with cash. Soon Bob's Bakery was at capacity and he wanted a second store. He found one in a local shopping mall and he took the lease with a further loan from the bank to buy the equipment. The second store was nowhere near as good as the first. He also found himself stretched between the stores which then caused the performance of the first store to drop. 

			There were many problems with quality, consumption and employee issues. Eventually the cash ran out and Bob was in trouble. Bob did not have any systems in place and did not produce monthly financial reports to measure the performance of the business. He did not have a clear understanding of the correct way to cost products to make a profit. Bob's business turned over almost 2 million dollars per year and due to his lack of business experience he had taken it to the brink of bankruptcy. This caused Bob and his wife huge stress and they did not know what to do.</p> 
			<br>
			<b>THE SOLUTION</b>
			<p>After the diagnostic meeting, it was determined that Bob’s Bakery was in a Rescue type situation.  The following is what action was taken to get his business out of that situation so that he could grow a profitable business:</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Immediate upgrade of the handling and control of cash within the business.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Immediate establishment of the exact financial position of the business.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Visit to the bank to meet the manager and outline the Business Success Program and the plan to improve the business.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Sale of both cars to release cash into the business.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Meetings with major creditors to enlist support and to outline future plans of the business.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Once the business was stable the Business Success Program commenced for long term growth and improvement.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="heading-bold">Scenario #2</p>
			<br>
			<p>Sun-Out Covers</p>
			<br>
			<b>THE PROBLEM</b>
			<p class="info">Sun-Out Covers was started by Jackie in 1992 and had grown to a turnover of 1.5 million dollars per year. They produced shade covers for both domestic and commercial use and Jackie worked the business with her two sons. Jackie was referred to a Strategic Business Consultant by her accountant who was observing a steady drop in earnings over the last few years and was concerned with a sudden drop in the last financial year to the point that the business was approaching insolvency. Jackie was really in a state of depression and confided in the consultant that she had really hit rock bottom emotionally. On the surface things seemed okay but once the Business Success Partner completed a business diagnostic many negative issues surfaced:</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Family members had given themselves a substantial pay increase without any financial forecasting being done to ascertain whether this could be afforded.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Products being manufactured were being quoted based on a competitor's price list from 2002.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">There was no systematic way to actually produce a quote. And the waste being cut off whole rolls of fabric was not charged to the job.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">There were no financial controls at all and no monthly reports being produced.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Jackie had a limited understanding of the financial requirements of running a business.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">There was no marketing plan to develop more business and they just waited for it to come in the door.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">There had been a drop of 30% in sales.</p>
			<br>
			<b>THE SOLUTION</b>
			<p class="info">Strategic Business Consulting commenced the Business Success Program and established what Jackie actually wanted out of her business. This is called a 'Business Vision' and it is usually a set of five year goals. The diagnostic uncovered a number of important areas that needed prompt attention:</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Establish the exact financial position of the business.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Reduce the income of the family members to what it was previously.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Introduce a comprehensive product costing and quoting process to ensure every job made a profit.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Gross profit was increased by 24%.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Introduce an accurate monthly financial and KPI reporting system.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Develop a total marketing plan to gain more customers.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Re-brand the business and products as the brand looked tired and out of date.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Developed budgets and cash flow forecasts for presentation to the bank.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Get all suppliers to re-quote, resulting in a saving of 9%.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="info">It took 12 months for the business to turn around and then salaries were restored. The owners now understood the value of accurate timely financial reporting and learnt how to make products cheaper and sell them for more than they had previously. The stress and pressure was off Jackie and she actually enjoyed coming to work every day. The next twelve months they planned to acquire a loss-making competitor with a turnover of $800,000 for almost no investment as the owner would accept a job with them as payment. Turnover is expected to reach 2.7 million dollars with profits increasing 400% since the time of crisis.</p>

				<h1 id="navAbout" class="announcer">About Us</h1>
				<div class="breaker" style="background: #800000 !important;"></div>
				<p class="info">Hello, my name is Robert Pierson, and I am excited that you are considering me to be your strategic business success partner.  Having been self employed for 20+ years, I understand the hurdles you are going through as a business owner.<br>

				Over my career, I have built and sold multiple companies; from tech to professional carpet and upholstery cleaning services.  The first two companies that I built from the ground up and sold were in the technology field.  In each case, the business was running quite well when I owned it but after the new owner took over, well, sad to say, they ran it into the ground.  At this point I could see that not all people have the skills needed to operate a business.  With the third business that I sold, I took a much more active process in training the new owner and set him and his wife on a path to success.<br>

				Bottom line, I have a passion for helping business owners to succeed and help them realize the original reason why they went into business to begin with.  I bring to the table strong skills in leadership, communication and creative problem solving. I have an investment in the tools to help analyze and engineer your business for success.  I am a strong proponent in continuing education, and I am always working on my skill sets so as to help yours.<br>

				I invite you to schedule a free business consultation.  It just might be the best decision of your business career!<br><br>

			<h1 id="navFAQ" class="announcer">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<div class="breaker"></div>
			<br>
			<b>HOW MUCH WILL THE BUSINESS SUCCESS PROGRAM COST?</b>
			<br><br> 
			<p class="p-border-accent">This varies from client to client depending on your business size and how much work has to be done. As a general rule the investment you make is returned many times over in the first few months of us working together.</p> 
			<br><br>
			<b>WHY IS THE BUSINESS SUCCESS PROGRAM OVER A LONG TERM?</b>
			<br><br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">The Business Success Program is a comprehensive business consulting program that improves your business profitability and value over a multi year time frame. It takes time to smoothly make permanent changes in your business that will dramatically improve the profitability and value.</p>
			<br><br>
			<b>DO I NEED ANY SPECIAL TRAINING?</b>
			<br><br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">No, we are intensively trained to help you in every area of your business.</p>
			<br><br>
			<b>WHY DO I NEED A BUSINESS SUCCESS PARTNER?</b>
			<br><br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">We find many of our clients are very good at what they do but lack expertise and experience in the finer points of running a successful business. These finer points are the ones that make the real money in your business and your Business Success Partner is trained in these important business skills.</p>
			<br><br>
			<b>HOW QUICKLY WILL I SEE RESULTS?</b>
			<br><br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">The Business Success Program has been designed to start delivering results to the business owner very quickly; in fact you will see noticeable progress within 3 months of commencement.</p> 
			<br><br>
			<b>HOW CAN YOU BE SO CONFIDENT THAT YOU CAN HELP ME?</b>
			<br><br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Nearly all businesses are structurally similar. We believe that with our unique skills in creating successful businesses and your industry-specific skills, we can jointly make a huge success of your business.</p>
			<br><br>
			<b>ARE YOU A BUSINESS COACH?</b>
			<br><br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">A Business Coach tends to work with the business owner on the business owner. However, we work with the business owner on the business itself. We are business improvement specialists. Experience and skills in business are necessary to get a business performing at its best.</p>
			<br><br>
			<b>I'VE HAD CONSULTANTS BEFORE - THEY JUST WRITE UP A PLAN AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENS. I WANT THINGS TO HAPPEN.</b>
			<br><br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">Some consultants only help write plans as they often lack the experience to turn the plan into reality. Also implementation, or rather the lack of it, is a problem with many small and medium-sized businesses and it's true that most plans sit on the shelf or in a drawer after they're written. Strategic Business Consulting takes a different approach - <b>we help build a plan and then we help turn it into reality.</b> We stay with you to make things happen. When a plan is done properly, it makes the business owner consider the things that are necessary to make the business run much more effectively and profitably.</p>
			<br><br>
			<b>DO YOU TAKE ON JUST ANY BUSINESS?</b>
			<br><br>
			<p class="p-border-accent">The short answer is no. Part of our business vision is to make other businesses a success. If a business owner is engaged in questionable business practices or anything illegal we absolutely will decline having any dealings with such a company. Other business owners are stuck in a rut; that despite all practical efforts, they refuse to implement changes that they themselves helped to establish. Working with such businesses becomes counterproductive. We only take on a limited number of clients so that we can give each client the needed support they require.</p>
